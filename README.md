## ðŸ’Ž Comprehensive Analysis of Round Shape Diamonds (0.7ct â€“ 0.89ct)

###  Goal
To compare **Lab Grown** and **Natural Diamonds** based on their **Color**, **Clarity**, and **Average Price/Carat**, and to evaluate how these factors influence pricing using regression analysis and statistical modeling.

---

###  Learnings
- Applied regression modeling and statistical methods to pricing data.
- Identified how quality attributes like **color** and **clarity** affect diamond prices.
- Observed distinct pricing trends between **lab grown** and **natural diamonds**.
- Practiced data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to support insights.

---

### Findings
- **Natural diamonds** have a higher price per carat across all clarity and color levels.
- **Color** has a stronger influence on price than clarity, especially in natural diamonds.
- **Lab grown diamonds** show price clustering around lower clarity grades (SI1, SI2).
- Regression models show **strong predictability** (RÂ² > 0.90 for all models).
- **Heatmaps and covariance analysis** support the price variation across quality levels.
